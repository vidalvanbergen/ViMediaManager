		This module contains methods that help checking a receipt file
		as it's used with applications delivered by Apple's App Store.

	#tag Note, Name = Usage
		IsValid:
		
		  Call CertTools.IsValid, passing the results from CertTools.DeviceGUID
		  and CertTools.ReadReceipt to it. If it returns false, this means that the
		  app was not certified to run on this particular computer (App Store apps
		  are certified per machine). In order to tell Mac OS X about this fact,
		  exit the app with the exit code 173, which should then lead to the user
		  being asked to re-certify this app for this computer (which will probably
		  ask the user for his iTunes login, then checking if he has purchased the
		  app from the store and thus is a valid user)
		
		ReadReceipt:
		
		  Pass the location of the receipt file, which gets stored (by the App Store
		  delivery code) inside your app in "Contents/_MASReceipt/".
		
		Example:
		
		  dim f as FolderItem
		  if IsLion then
		    f = NSBundle.MainBundle.AppStoreReceiptDirectory()
		  else
		    f = App.ExecutableFile.Parent.Parent // "Contents" folder
		    f = f.Child("_MASReceipt").Child("receipt") // this is where the App Store puts the receipt when "buying" an app
		  end
		  if not CertTools.IsValid (CertTools.DeviceGUID, CertTools.ReadReceipt(f), "put the App's Application Identifier here") then
		    declare sub exit_ lib "System" alias "exit" (code as Integer)
		    exit_ (173)
		  end
		
		Tips:
		
		  Be aware that a cracker might attempt to disable your checking code so that
		  he can make your app run on any computer, then distribute either the cracking
		  code or your app thru other channels.
		
		  In general, a good cracker will find ways to accomplish this, and you can't do
		  anything about it. So better accept this possibility right now.
		
		  However, here are some hints as to how to make it not too easy for a casual or
		  lazy cracker:
		
		  â€¢ Rename the module and its functions, possibly to names that do not hint at
		  their purpose. That makes it harder for a cracker to even find the functions
		  he needs to patch. (Note: the method and module names may appear in the
		  generated code, while local variables don't, so do not bother renaming the
		  variables - but to be sure better look at the generated code, e.g. with the "nm"
		  command line too.)
		
		  â€¢ In a similar way, avoid having the code that decides to exit the app be very close
		  to the call that calls IsValid. Instead, call the various functions in different places
		  so that a cracker has a hard time to find the place where the actual test of the receipt
		  takes place. For instance, he might start looking at the code that calls the exit
		  function, so make sure that's not the only place where an invalid receipt is acted
		  upon. Better to modify some other globals in your app after calling IsValid, and
		  use some effect of these globals later to decide whether to exit the app. That way,
		  the cracker can find the exit call, but that's long after your app has already gotten
		  into a state where it won't function any more. So the cracker would have to do a lot
		  of backtracing to find the code that actually makes the receipt check and decision
		  thereupon.
