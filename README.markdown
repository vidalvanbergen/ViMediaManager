## ViMediaManager ##

ViMediaManager is a media manager for Mac OS X, allowing you to gather, store, and manage information, extra art, trailers and television tunes for your movie, television and anime collections, and can be used on it's own, or in combination with [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) and [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/).

This is my try at building a media manager for macOS, since the Mac platform has been seriously lacking any good apps in this department, and I felt like filling that hole, keeping in mind the Mac's passion for ease-of-use while still building a very powerful program with an easy-to-use interface.

## F.A.Q.? ##

#### Some of my movies aren't showing up in the list, what's up with that?
ViMediaManager needs your files to be in a certain structure to be able to work with them:

Movies Root Folder  
- - Movie Title Folder  
- - - Movie File  
- - Movie Title Folder  
- - - Movie File  

But don't worry, you won't have to restructure your movies by hand, just select the 'Tools' menu and choose the 'Put Movies Into Folders' option, which will automatically place all movie files it finds in the 'root' folder inside their own folders.


#### Does your app show studio/network logo's?
Yes it does, but you'll have to download them separately from this thread: (or similar threads)

Once you've downloaded these, navigate to:  
/users/YOURNAME/Library/Application Support/ViMediaManager/  
Create a new folder named "Studios" and put the images directly into this folder.
